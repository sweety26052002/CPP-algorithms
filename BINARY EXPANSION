BINARY EXPANSION
This is used to find the powers of a number which works in O(LogN).
Suppose, If we have a number A=4.To find 4^5 we normally 4*4*4*4*4 which runs a loop for 5 times.
For 4^100 we run a loop for 100 times which leads to TLE(time limit exceeded).
So to avoid TLE we use BINARY EXPANSION.
CODE:

#include<bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;
int power(int A,int n)
{
	if(n==0)return 1;
	int x=power(A,n/2);
	if(n%2==0)return x*x;
	else return x*x*A;
}
int main()
{
	int A;
	cin>>A;
	int n;
	cin>>n;
	cout<<power(A,n);
}
